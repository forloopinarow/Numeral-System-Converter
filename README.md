# Java FX (Eveythings a bit scuffed, didnt properly manage the files, will try to fix, lwky just ignore everything under this)

The install process shouldnt have changed from the main branch read me, only diffrence that could appear at 4. is that it might not work, Try this first (using Maven's JavaFX plugin):
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
java -cp target/BaseConversion-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.example.BaseConverter
```

Nvm pretty sure mvn javafx:run doesnt work, its 3:39 for me so I will not be trying to figure out the problem at this time

Wouldnt recommend using this since the terminal is btter anyways and im not finished with this yet

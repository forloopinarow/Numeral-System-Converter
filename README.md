# Java FX

The install process shouldnt have changed from the main branch read me, only diffrence that could appear at 4. is that it might not work, Try this first (using Maven's JavaFX plugin):
```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
java -cp target/BaseConversion-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.example.BaseConverter
```

Wouldnt recommend using this since the terminal is btter anyways and im not finished with this yet
